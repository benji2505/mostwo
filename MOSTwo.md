# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for MOSTwo

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Author**: Grok 3 (xAI)  
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for **MOSTwo**, an automation tool designed to configure, monitor, and control hardware components (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino) through a web interface. MOSTwo enables users to define digital and analog inputs/outputs, implement logical, timed, and counting operations, save configurations as "machine" files, and create reusable sequences called "events." The system supports real-time hardware monitoring, simulation mode, a visual drag-and-drop editor, plugin extensibility, and IoT integration.

### 1.2 Scope
MOSTwo targets hobbyists, engineers, and developers working with hardware automation. Key features include:
- Support for multiple hardware platforms (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, extensible via plugins).
- Digital and analog inputs/outputs with logical (AND, OR, NOT), timed (delays, schedules), and counting (thresholds, resets) operations.
- JSON-based "machine" files for hardware configurations and "event" files for reusable sequences with looping, branching, and parallel execution.
- Web-based frontend with a visual editor and real-time monitoring.
- Backend with asynchronous callback pattern, error handling, and recovery mechanisms.
- IoT integration via MQTT and plugin support for custom hardware/logic.
- Deployment in local (Raspberry Pi) or client-server models.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Machine**: A JSON file defining a set of hardware inputs, outputs, and associated logic.
- **Event**: A JSON file defining a reusable sequence of actions (e.g., set output, wait, loop) that can be applied to multiple machines.
- **Component**: A hardware input or output (digital or analog) connected to a specific pin on a hardware interface.
- **Plugin**: A dynamically loaded module extending hardware or logic functionality.

## 2. User Personas

- **Hobbyist Engineer**: Builds small-scale automation projects (e.g., home automation) using Raspberry Pi or Arduino.
